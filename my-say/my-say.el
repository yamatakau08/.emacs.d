;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides simple commands to make Emacs speak text aloud
;; using the macOS `say` command.
;;
;; Example usage:
;;   M-x my-say-word
;;   M-x my-say-line
;;   M-x my-say-region
;;   M-x my-say-buffer
;;   M-x my-say-stop
;;
;; To customize voice and rate:
;;   M-x customize-group RET my-say RET

;;; Code:

(defgroup my-say nil
  "Text-to-speech using macOS `say` command."
  :group 'multimedia
  :prefix "my-say-")

;;;; Customization

(defcustom my-say-voice "Samantha"
  "The voice used for speech synthesis.
Default is the system voice configured in macOS.
To list available voices, run the command `say -v ?` in a shell."
  :type 'string
  :group 'my-say)

(defcustom my-say-rate 160
  "Speech rate in words per minute.
This value is passed to the `-r` option of the macOS `say` command.
See `man say` for details and https://multilingual-jonny.com/reading-speed-wpm/ for reading speed references."
  :type 'integer
  :group 'my-say)

(defcustom my-say-asynchronous t
  "If non-nil, speak asynchronously using `start-process`.
If nil, speak synchronously using `shell-command-to-string`.
Asynchronous mode allows Emacs to remain responsive during speech playback."
  :type 'boolean
  :group 'my-say)

;;;; Internal Variables
(defvar my-say--process nil
  "Internal variable holding the current `say` process when running asynchronously.")

;;;;;; Command

;;;###autoload

If there is no word at point, display a message instead."

  "Speak the current line using the macOS `say` command."
  (interactive)

    (my-say--execute my-say-voice my-say-rate line)))

;;;###autoload

Newlines are replaced with spaces before speaking."

  (interactive)
  (when (and my-say--process (process-live-p my-say--process))
    (kill-process my-say--process)
    (message "Speech stopped.")))

;;;; Internal Functions
(defun my-say--execute (voice rate content)
  "Speak CONTENT using the macOS `say` command with VOICE and RATE.
If `my-say-asynchronous` is non-nil, use `start-process` for non-blocking speech.
Otherwise, execute synchronously via `shell-command-to-string`."
